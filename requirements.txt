"""
This repository provides two requirement files to avoid installing heavy/optional
binary packages by default on Windows.

- requirements-core.txt: minimal packages required to run the app
- requirements-optional.txt: optional/advanced packages (lxml, gemini SDK, etc.)

Install the core dependencies first:

	.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-core.txt

If you need advanced features (image generation with Gemini SDK, extruct, or
faster HTML parsing with lxml), then install the optional set:

	.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-optional.txt
